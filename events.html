          <h3>VITRICITY</h3>
          <div>The fascinating Tesla coil, was the system that could
WIRELESSLY transmit electricity. The “Mad scientist”
experiment and the revolutionary invention of Nicola Tesla
led to the creation of the Tesla coil. It can do things that are
just plain cool i.e from lighting a bulb WIRELESSLY to shooting
lightning bolts. Inspired by his works Dr. Stiffler and Dr.
GBluer modified the Tesla coil to create SLAYER EXCITER.This is a modal window. You can do the following things with it:</p><br>
            <strong>Task :</strong><br>
1. Teams have to build a low voltage Tesla coil or Slayer<br>
Exciter of 9V.
2. Team will have to light a CFL using this coil.<br>
<strong>Materials used :</strong>
1. Switch<br>
2. 22 kilo ohm Resistor<br>
3. Transistor (2N-2222A)<br>
4. 9 V Battery and Battery connector<br>
5. PVC pipe (8.5cm long and 2cm Diameter)<br>
6. Enamelled copper wires (Different diameter for Primary
and secondary)<br>r
7. CFL (13 W)<br>
<strong>Judging Criteria</strong><br>
Winner will be decided on following basis:<br>
1. Power Generated by Slayer Exciter.<br>
2. Design of the Slayer Exciter.<br>
3. Conceptual understanding(In case of tie)<br>

          <div>
            <p>This is a modal window. You can do the following things with it:</p>
            Ever dreamt of being bombarded by a stream of resistors, diodes, capacitors and inductors? If yes, then it’s your time. Potray
            your talents and show us what these elements are capable of. "PIRATES OF CIRCUITS " an event which will scrutinize
            the Ohm, Farad and Henry with in you and will hallmark you as the king of circuits, if you emerge as the winner.
            Practical knowledge combined with what you learned within the walls of the classroom is what you require to attain
            the ultimate glory.
            <br> So let the frenzy, furores and fuss of the circuits run through your veins and prepare yourself not to get ELECTROCUTED!
            <br>
            <strong>Theme:</strong>
            <br> The theme of this event " PIRATES OF CIRCUITS " is ELECTIONS.As every election becomes a heated topic to discuss
            in the society, it is time to incorporate your interest in electrical and electronics on this election theme.
            To participate in this event all one needs is basic knowledge about electrical and electronics (mainly digital)
            concepts.
            <br>
            <strong>Problem Statement:</strong>
            <br> Using electrical and electronic concepts to decode sequences and build the circuits.
            <br>
            <strong>Round 1:</strong>
            <br> Here the participant will be given story where every character in the story will be described with respect to
            electrical components' characteristics. The participant has to identify what these characters corresponds to
            in electrical elements. And then connect the identified elements in the particular sequence, as mentioned, on
            a bread board. And has to identify across which element the given LED bulb will glow.
            <br>
            <strong>.EXAMPLE:</strong>
            <br> Each character represents an electrical element. The behavior of the person corresponds to the element's characteristics.Using
            these as clues identify what each character is in electrical analogy.
            <br>
            <strong>Character A:</strong> Doesn't think of the past. He thinks only of the future.
            <br>
            <strong>Character B:</strong> Adopts and responds immediately to all situations.
            <br>
            <strong>Character C:</strong> Doesn't like changes in life.
            <br> Relate these clues to the elements' behavior and identify these characters. Then, connect these elements so
            that there is no current division between them on the given bread board. Now, identify across which element the
            LED will glow. ( You will be provided with a 12V battery)
            <br>
            <strong>Round 2:</strong>
            <br> The final round is called ‘The Stock Game’.
            <br> Three teams will be participating in this round.
            <br> A circuit will be given to each team containing four resistances and a voltage source. In this stock game, three
            resistor manufacturing companies will set their base price for different values of resistance.
            <br> Initially all three teams will be given 30 virtual rupees. Then each team will sell or buy their stock based
            on market value of resistance of particular company. At the end money left with each team shows the value of
            voltage source they will use in their circuit.
            <br> Each team should have at least 4 resistors with them at the end of game. Finally based on the circuit given
            in starting they will connect voltages and resistor and will calculate power
            <br> Team with max power will win the electrohunt.
            <br>
            <strong>JUDGING CRITERIA:</strong>
            <br> Judging for the FIRST round is based on the number of identified elements and how close the obtained output
            is to the desired criteria. In the second round, judgment will be based on the method that has been adopted to
            complete the circuit and to display the output. Rules and Regulations:-
            <br> * The participants must have a valid college ID.
            <br> * Mobiles and calculators should not be used during the event.
            <br> * In case of any fraud or cheating, the participant will be disqualified from the competition.
            <br> * Organizers reserve the right to change rules as they consider fit.
            <br>* Decision of the judges will be final and binding to all.

            <p>Are you inherently curious or intrusive? To the extent where it usually lands you in trouble? No problem! Brain_o_riddle is here to cater for your curious minds. Put your thinking caps on and register quickly . Winners receive exciting prizes. This event will test the basic knowledge of electrical and presence of mind.</p><br>
            <strong>ROUND 1:</strong>

This round is based on crossword question.<br>


The team which completes the crossword first will qualify for next round.<br>

Crossword question will be based on general electrical question, invention, facts. Per team can have maximum two member .
<br>

<strong>ROUND 2: </strong>

Second round is quiz+circuit designing event.<br>

A question will be asked. 5 team which will respond first, will be given chance to answer the question ,for correct answer they will pick up a token from the bowl having several tokens.<br>

Each token will be having different electrical component.<br>

Questions will be asked till a team build a complete electrical circuit.<br>

Electrical circuit must comprise of 4 element.(must have atleast one Energy source)<br>

A team giving three continuously correct answer(hatric) will be given any electrical component of their choice.<br>

Any Team giving an answer incorrectly have to return any electrical component which they have earned back into the bowl.<br>r

<strong>Note:</strong>
Usage of mobile phone during event will lead to automatic expulsion.<br>
<strong>Judging criterion:</strong>

The judging criterion is based on the speed and accuracy of the competing team.
Any misbehaviour would automatically lead to disqualification.<br>
